Flag0: Hint- Something looks out of place with checkout
      -Upon inspection, on the checkout place, we can see how the cart actually tracks what items you are buying and what not.
      -Using inspect element, we can see it is a field with input type hidden and lists all the items including the price.
      -Change the input type to text and you are now able to edit the prices for items. Put them all as 0 and press check out.
      -The check out page will now say your total is 0 and the flag will be there.
